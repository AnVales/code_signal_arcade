# Last night you partied a little too hard. 
# Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral! 
# You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

# The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. 
# The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: 
# Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center at x, 
# including x itself. 
# All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.

# Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
